# Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project was developed as part of a collaborative machine learning assignment, where our objective was to design a predictive model capable of identifying individuals at high risk of defaulting on their loans. By leveraging historical loan data, our model aims to assist financial institutions in making more informed lending decisions, ultimately minimizing credit risk.

## Objective

The core goal of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline that:

- Analyzes historical loan application data.
- Identifies key patterns and features that contribute to loan defaults.
- Predicts the likelihood of default for future applicants with high accuracy and reliability.

## Dataset

We utilized a comprehensive loan dataset containing features such as:

- Applicant income
- Employment status
- Loan amount and term
- Credit history
- Debt-to-income ratio
- Number of previous delinquencies
- And several other relevant financial indicators

The dataset was cleaned, preprocessed, and split into training and testing sets to ensure robust model evaluation.

## Methodology

Our approach followed the typical machine learning lifecycle:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and outliers
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Scaled numerical features
   - Addressed class imbalance using resampling techniques

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identified significant correlations between features and default status
   - Visualized distributions and trends to inform model selection

3. **Modeling**:
   - Evaluated multiple classification algorithms, including:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - KNN
   - Support Vector Machines
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning using grid search and cross-validation

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
   - Selected the best-performing model based on its ability to balance false positives and false negatives

5. ## Results

Our final model demonstrated strong performance on the test dataset, particularly excelling in identifying high-risk individuals with a favorable balance of precision and recall. Key highlights include:

   - Accuracy**: 84%
   - Precision**: 91%
   - Recall**: 33%
   - ROC-AUC**: 0.74

## Future Work

To further enhance the modelâ€™s performance and applicability, future iterations of this project could explore:

   - Integrating alternative data sources (e.g., social or behavioral data)
   - Deploying the model as a real-time web API
   - Building a dashboard for visualizing applicant risk profiles
   - Monitoring model drift and retraining with updated datasets

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in the financial services sector, showcasing how data science can enhance credit risk evaluation. Our model provides a foundation for risk-aware lending practices and represents a step toward more intelligent, data-driven loan underwriting.
